Welcome to my **AI Learning Journey** — a structured, self-paced roadmap to becoming proficient in AI, machine learning, deep learning, and beyond. This repo tracks my progress and resources, and serves as a public portfolio of my path into the world of artificial intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This journey is divided into **6 focused phases**, each building on the previous one. The plan includes learning key concepts, working on projects, and building a portfolio ready for real-world applications.

| Phase | Focus Area                                
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Foundations: Python, Math, Git             |
| 2     | Machine Learning + Projects                |
| 3     | Deep Learning + Projects                   |
| 4     | Specialization (CV / NLP / RL) + Projects  |
| 5     | MLOps + Deployment                         |
| 6     | Portfolio Polish + Job Prep                |
